<p>Triangle, pentagonal, and hexagonal numbers are generated by the following formulae:</p>
<table>
<tr><td>Triangle</td><td>T<sub>n</sub>=n(n+1)/2</td><td>1, 3, 6, 10, 15,... </td></tr>
<tr><td>Pentagonal</td><td>P<sub>n</sub>=n(3n−1)/2</td><td>1, 5, 12, 22, 35, ...</td></tr>
<tr><td>Hexagonal</td><td>H<sub>n</sub>=n(2n−1)</td><td>1, 6, 15, 28, 45, ... </td></tr>
</table>
<p>It can be verified that T<sub>285</sub> = P<sub>165</sub> = H<sub>143</sub> = 40755.</p>
<p>Find the next triangle number that is also pentagonal and hexagonal.</p>
